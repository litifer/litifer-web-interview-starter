Fantasy football has transformed the way fans engage with the sport, adding an interactive and strategic layer to the traditional act of watching games. Participants, often grouped in leagues with friends or colleagues, act as team managers, drafting real-world players to their fantasy teams. Each week, these virtual teams earn points based on the actual on-field performances of their chosen players. The beauty of fantasy football lies in the decisions it demands: Who to draft? Who to start or bench each week? When to make a crucial trade? Beyond the strategy, the camaraderie and friendly rivalries that emerge within leagues deepen the football experience, making every touchdown and every yard gained a cause for celebration or despair. As both a test of football knowledge and a social experience, fantasy football has become an integral part of the sport's culture.
